		<h1>Jesse Vollmar & Brad Koch-Home grown success</h1>


		<p>Brad Koch, 2011, B.S., and Jesse Vollmar, 2011, B.S.,&nbsp;weren&rsquo;t typical college students. As incoming&nbsp;freshmen at SVSU, the two were already running&nbsp;a successful IT consulting business. Since their&nbsp;2011 graduation, both with a Bachelor of Science&nbsp;in computer science, they&rsquo;ve also &ldquo;graduated&rdquo; from their&nbsp;initial business and have started a new company, FarmLogs,&nbsp;which has attracted a lot of investor interest as well as $5<br />million in venture capital.<br /><img src="farmlogs.jpg" alt="" style="border : 5; padding : 10px 10px 10px 10px ; margin : 15x 15x 15x 15x; display: block; float : left;" />&ldquo;Proximity was a key factor [in choosing SVSU],&rdquo; Jesse said.&nbsp;The financial assistance each received was also helpful. As&nbsp;co-valedictorians of their graduating class at Union-Sebewaing&nbsp;High School in Michigan&rsquo;s Thumb, both received the&nbsp;President&rsquo;s Scholarship at SVSU, which covered their tuition&nbsp;and select fees for four years. <br />&ldquo;Brad and I started our company in high school,&rdquo; Jesse said, &ldquo;and it was taking off. I knew I wanted to continue operating it while obtaining a degree, so moving [too far] away [from home] wasn&rsquo;t an option. SVSU was in the right place.&rdquo;<br />Brad agreed, adding that the scholarship gave them the financial security to channel more effort into their business. <br />&ldquo;We were able to learn while working,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And we could apply things we were learning to actual clients.&rdquo;</p>
		<h3><strong>Seed of an Idea</strong></h3>
		<p>Having grown up in farming communities, Brad and Jesse&nbsp;were familiar with the challenges farmers face, including a&nbsp;lack of technological sophistication in agriculture generally.&nbsp;While their IT consulting business was successful, both Jesse&nbsp;and Brad recognized they could do more.<br />&ldquo;With our consulting business, we were building software&nbsp;for an agricultural client,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;We realized there was a&nbsp;huge need in the agricultural sector and nobody was building&nbsp;software for farmers.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;The light bulb moment came at my family&rsquo;s farm,&rdquo; Jesse&nbsp;added. &ldquo;I was in the office, and another farmer asked me if&nbsp;we were ready with our software. We weren&rsquo;t even creating&nbsp;software yet, but that was the moment we decided we could&nbsp;make it successful.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;It&rdquo; would be FarmLogs, a web application for farm&nbsp;management. <br />Jesse said he and Brad &ldquo;daydreamed&rdquo; about the project for&nbsp;about six months before they began working on the app. The&nbsp;product and the process were made better after participating&nbsp;in Y Combinator, a program that provides seed money, advice, networking and guidance to business startups, especially those in the technology sector.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We went full-scale into FarmLogs on Jan. 3, 2012, the first&nbsp;day of Y Combinator,&rdquo; Jesse said. From there, the product and&nbsp;the business grew nicely, and today the app is being used by&nbsp;farmers.<br />From their company headquarters in Ann Arbor, Brad and&nbsp;Jesse see a future ripe with possibility.<br />&ldquo;Ag needs data technology,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;Existing players&nbsp;weren&rsquo;t providing it. We&rsquo;re here to make sure that changes;&nbsp;we&rsquo;re bringing people the software they need.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;There are decades of innovation to be built,&rdquo; added Jesse.<br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be working on FarmLogs for a very long time.&rdquo;</p>
